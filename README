This set of scripts should be preserved on the github.

If a new set of scripts is created, it should be separate and with a new version number.

The tutorials associated with these scripts can be found at:
https://ringo.ams.stonybrook.edu/index.php/Benchmarking_Lab_SOPs

Choose the tutorial version which matches the set of scripts used.

NOTE: While Testset construction and Benchmarking tutorials are on same page on wiki, these repositories are deliberately kept separate, as it is not always necessary to run both testset construction in pair with Benchmarking
