This set of scripts should be preserved on the github.

If a new set of scripts is created, it should be separate and with a new version number.

The tutorials associated with these scripts can be found at:
https://ringo.ams.stonybrook.edu/index.php/Benchmarking_Lab_SOPs

The "SB2024_V1 DOCK6.10 A" version of each tutorial (if multiple) will be the one associated with these scripts
