This is where the Rizzo protocols are outlined with input files and anaylsis scripts.
This directory will be used to align all systems in a family to a single reference. This step is only to be done if you are building a new set for crossdocking 
besides the already built and prepared set.

You will need text files for:
- A list of Family names.
- A text file titled for each Family name containing the list of PDB codes in that family. (The first in the list will be used as the reference ...
it may be wise to use the receptor with the most residues or highest resolution as the reference at your discrepency)

A SAMPLE STRUCTURE OF THIS IS PROVIDED IN: Sample_Family_List_and_Codes

The script which accomplishes this aligntment is called with:

	""  tcsh run.match.complex.csh ""
