Directory Architecture
  A testset should be prepared with separate subdirectories for each system being tested.


Running Pose Reproduction
  Set all appropriate variables in 001.submit_dock.sh
    sbatch 001.submit_dock.sh
    or
    bash 001.submit_dock.sh

Analysis
  Load python3 or anaconda3 module

  python calculate_dock6.results.py $condition_$seed $system_file
    Insert values from 001.submit_dock.sh for command line arguments. Cat condition and seed (ie Default_0)

Trouble shooting
  Are compilers for running DOCK loaded?
