Directory Architecture
  A testset should be prepared with separate subdirectories for each system being tested.

  Each subdirectory should have appropriate files for docking that system (actives and decoys in separate multi- mol2) 
	-Names should be actives_final.mol2 and decoys_final.mol2

Running Database Enrichment
  It is highly recommended to run this in parallel. DOCK takes on average 90 seconds to dock a single molecule on a single core.

  Set all appropriate variables in 001.submit_dock.sh 
    sbatch 001.submit_dock.sh  
    or 
    bash 001.submit_dock.sh 

Analysis
  Set variables in 002.analysis.sh
  Load python3 or anaconda3 module
    bash 002.analysis.sh

Trouble Shooting
  These scripts assume the string "MOLECULE" occurs once per individual molecule in multi-mol2
  If this is not the case - replace MOLE with other appropriate string in scripts
